                        Hi there! My name is ${NAME}, known better online as DumbAsARoc. I'm a longtime programmer,
                        a Senior CS Major at @{INSERT SCHOOL}, a musician, and a platform fighter player. I am very
                        passionate about computing, programming, and software design - in particular, I love UI
                        design and the process of "stupid-proofing" interfaces. In addition, I have recently begun to
                        love the lowest-level of programming - that is, working directly with hardware in assembly
                        and no-standard-library C.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 3vw; width: 100%;">
                        At current, my favorite programming languages (in no particular order) are C, C++, and Rust,
                        as they gel best with my preferred applications of coding, as well as being strong candidates
                        for just about any standalone application. I am also strong in standard web development,
                        other object-oriented languages like Java, data-driven languages like Python and R, as well
                        as x86 Assembly.
                    </p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 3vw; width: 100%;">
                        Outside of programming, I am a longtime trombone player - I've been playing the instrument
                        since the 5th grade! I've played with multiple groups, including @{FORMER SCHOOL}'s Pep
                        Band and @{INSERT SCHOOL}'s Wind Ensemble. Additionally, I am also passionate about a
                        subset of fighting games called platform fighters, which include games like Super Smash
                        Brothers and Rivals of Aether. I am the current president and tournament organizer of
                        @{INSERT SCHOOL}'s Super Smash Brothers club as a part of that passion.

            <div class="section" style="--section-width: 50%;">
                <h3 class="sectiontitle">What is this site?</h3>
                <div class="sectioncontent">
                    <!-- style="text-indent: 3vw; width: 100%;" -->
                    <p>
                        There are 3 big reasons I want to develop this site in the way that it is:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Primarily, I want to document my progress in a (hopefully) interesting
                            medium for other people (or even my future self) to come find. I guess
                            I'm almost hoping this will end up being a time capsule of sorts!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Secondly, this site is here as a resource for other people that are interested in the
                            same things I am. If I help anyone out of a programatic jam through the
                            writings on this site, I will be very happy!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Finally, and most superficially, I want this as a resource for future
                            employers to see how passionate I am about this field, and my competence
                            in the field. The current job market (as of 10/18/2024) is quite bad,
                            so standing out in any way is very important. Hopefully, this will make
                            a difference!
